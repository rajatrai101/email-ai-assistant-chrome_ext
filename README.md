1. Get a Gemini API Key
First, you need an API key to use the AI.

Go to Google AI Studio.

Click "Create API key in new project".

Copy the generated API key. You will need it in a later step.

2. Save the Extension Files
Create a new folder on your computer named gmail-ai-assistant.

Inside that folder, save each of the code blocks above into files with their corresponding names:

manifest.json

content.js

styles.css

popup.html

popup.js

Create or download a 128x128 pixel PNG image, name it icon.png, and save it in the same folder.

3. Load the Extension in Chrome
Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.

In the top right corner, turn on "Developer mode".

Three new buttons will appear: "Load unpacked," "Pack extension," and "Update." Click on "Load unpacked".

A file selection dialog will open. Navigate to and select the gmail-ai-assistant folder you created.

4. Configure and Use the Extension
The "Gmail AI Reply Assistant" extension will now appear in your list of extensions. Click the puzzle piece icon in your Chrome toolbar and pin the extension for easy access.

Click on the extension's icon. A popup will appear.

Paste the Gemini API key you got from step 1 into the input box and click "Save Key".

Go to your Gmail and open any email. You should see a new purple "âœ¨ Suggest Reply" button near the top of the email.

Click the button. A modal will appear, and after a few seconds, it will show you three reply suggestions.

You can click any suggestion to instantly paste it into the reply box! You can also type a note and click "Refine" to get new suggestions based on your input.
